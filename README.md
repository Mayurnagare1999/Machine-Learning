The project is organized as follows:

- **Datasets**: A collection of datasets used for training, testing, and demonstrating machine learning models.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks that contain the implementation of various machine learning models, algorithms, and techniques.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for specific tasks, data preprocessing, and model training.
- **Requirements**: A `requirements.txt` file to set up the necessary Python environment for running the code.

## Implemented Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Linear Regression** (Simple and Multiple)
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Decision Trees and Random Forest**
